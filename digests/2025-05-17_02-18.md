## [MLQuestions] How to learn Machine Learning? My Roadmap

You don't just need to learn the math and algorithms but, start with the math . Expectation is to get an initial grasp of a lot of different things . A lot of this stuff takes many repetitions and projects to understand well . Start with Ng courses they are very good and cover everything you need . Start from high level -&gt; then go deeper into the learning curve . Start by developing by developing, validate, evaluate, evaluate on test set set set . Train by developing and deploying multiple different model types along with evaluation, production monitoring, and iteration monitoring . Work on ML courses for hours per day can be hard, it's very active engaged learning . I'm expecting that it'll take about 3-5 years of constant work on this (probably about 2500 hours) to be competent . I've had a couple of nice work related data science projects that I fully commit time to when they come up with the coursework . I always apply methods to my own datasets and build my own implementations alongside the course work . I don't want to be a resident physician working many 80 hour weeks, so you can definitely fit this in with the rest of your life. I've found 6 hours on days off and 2-4 hours on work days off. I

## [learnmachinelearning] Is machine learning worth it?

Traditional machine learning has more applications in smaller scale and welll maths in there are much much more complicated than your average high school maths, though I myself is also in the process of learning . I would recommend you to start with traditional machine learning, linear, logistic kernels svm etc then only get into deep learning .

## [learnmachinelearning] Starting on Machine Learning

Starting on Machine Learning: Foundations (2-3 months) and Data Engineering (3-4 months) Learn ML theory, frameworks, and build deployable models . Learn to ship models to production using TensorFlow and PyTorch . Train a CNN for image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10) and build a recommendation system . Build a model locally using Docker and track performance with TONONX . Optimize a model with low-latency inference for low-Latency inference . Build CI/CD pipeline for CI-CD pipeline. Optimize ML (e., TONX +FX). Optimize model with Tensorflow/NX.optimize model . Build model on Amazon‚Äôs Cloud (Vertex AI) or AWS (SageMaker). Deploy a model on AWS (GCP/CP/GCP). Build a CI/CCP model with MLflow and track-ability . Use Python for CI/CTC/CTP to build a model for low Latitude/Latitude-Latitude/CTR . Use Tensor Flow/CTT to build an AI pipeline to create a model that can be used in the cloud. Use TONCTR to build models that can‚Äôt be used on the Cloud. Use a model in a cloud with a machine that could be used for data analysis. Use Python to analyze data from the cloud to analyze a model. Use the data pipeline. Use data from a machine with the cloud

## [technology] QAnon founder may have been identified thanks to machine learning

QAnon founder may have been identified thanks to machine learning . 99% of you won't read the article: it's **Paul Furber** (something some people had suspected almost from day 1). And eventually Ron Watkins (which a large number of people suspected as well). It‚Äôs too late. This has gotten so out of control, that even if JFK Jr. flew in on a manticore with Jesus on his back and they both denounced Qanon, these nut jobs still wouldn‚Äôt believe it .

## [woahdude] Machine learning generated images animation

Machine learning generated images animation . The animation was created by a neural net to generate a model that can generate new audio, be it gibberish . Every X number of frames were run through a specific Deep Dream model, with models fading in and out using a custom algorithm, which gives the video it's morphing feel . The audio was generated by feeding in hundreds of hours of audio into the neural net . More examples here: [https://://://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaVnriHhPc]

## [PhD] I hate "my" "field" (machine learning)

Most of the papers are variations on "we p-hacked our way to a better than SOTA result by running the experiment 20 times with different hyperparameters" I switched to neuroscience after a few years in engineering . People with ML backgrounds are very valuable in the field, and the difference is that people focus on *understanding* rather than *results*
