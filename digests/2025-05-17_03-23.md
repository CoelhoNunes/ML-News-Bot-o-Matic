## [MLQuestions] How to learn Machine Learning? My Roadmap

You don't just need to learn the math and algorithms but, start with the math . Expectation is to get an initial grasp of a lot of different things . A lot of this stuff takes many repetitions and projects to understand well . Start with Ng courses they are very good and cover everything you need . I'm expecting that it'll take about 3-5 years of constant work on this (probably about 2500 hours) to be competent . I've found 6 hours on days off and 2-4 hours on work days is a nice middle ground . I usually read 2 hours, work on math for 2 hours and work on ML courses for 2 . hours . I always apply methods to my own datasets and build my own implementations alongside the coursework . There are some good course courses that I've been looking at to get better at this myself. I've had a couple of nice work related data science projects that I fully commit time to when they come up . I would like to fully commit to these projects that were not working out well for me from a balance/guilt perspective . I found it a good balance between work and studying for my own data science project . I think it's actually a great idea to start slow and tickle away at it for a few months. It really must be a good idea to learn

## [learnmachinelearning] How I Started Learning Machine Learning

How I Started Learning Machine Learning with d2l.ai is best book i ever found . How I started learning Machine Learning? How did you learn the math needed as a pre-requirement? Pin this somehow since we get how to start questions every day .

## [learnmachinelearning] Is machine learning worth it?

Traditional machine learning has more applications in smaller scale and welll maths in there are much much more complicated than your average high school maths . There is plenty of work to do in machine learning and will be until we have AGI, there will be no more work for anyone, so your alternate path is also blocked . By definition its impossible to predict what happens after the singularity, so don't worry about trying to predict it .

## [learnmachinelearning] Starting on Machine Learning

Starting on Machine Learning: Foundations (2-3 months) and Data Engineering (3-4 months) Learn ML theory, frameworks, and build deployable models . Learn to ship models to production using TensorFlow and PyTorch . Train a CNN for image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10) and build a recommendation system . Build a model locally using Docker and track performance with TONONX . Optimize a model with low-latency inference for low-Latency inference . Build CI/CD pipeline for CI-CD pipeline. Optimize ML (e., TONX +FX). Optimize model with Tensorflow/NX.optimize model . Build model on Amazon‚Äôs Cloud (Vertex AI) or AWS (SageMaker). Deploy a model on AWS (GCP/CP/GCP). Build a CI/CCP model with MLflow and track-ability . Use Python for CI/CTC/CTP to build a model for low Latitude/Latitude-Latitude/CTR . Use Tensor Flow/CTT to build an AI pipeline to create a model that can be used in the cloud. Use TONCTR to build models that can‚Äôt be used on the Cloud. Use a model in a cloud with a machine that could be used for data analysis. Use Python to analyze data from the cloud to analyze a model. Use the data pipeline. Use data from a machine with the cloud

## [nottheonion] Discord is assigning gender to users with machine learning AI

Discord is assigning gender to users with machine learning AI . Reddit is already doing this too, and it's not really accurate . Why Discord would want to predict the gender of users is unclear . Sex, race, income, pretty much any demo data, places you've visited... At a minimum it's all being collected and sold as audience data .

## [ProgrammerHumor] From Hello world to directly Machine Learning?

A friend asked me to explain Machine Learning to him . He wanted to use it for reading plots of stock prices from his screen to predict what the stock exchange would do . He also has no background in maths and no clue how ML works . I see a lot of ML courses online and i don't know if they are linear regression courses with a few buzzwords or if people are really going headfirst into machine learning that easily .

## [woahdude] Machine learning generated images animation

Machine learning generated images animation . The animation was created by a Deep Dream model, with models fading in and out using a custom algorithm . The audio was generated by feeding in hundreds of hours of audio into a neural net to generate a model that can generate new audio, be it gibberish . More examples of the animation are available here: [https://://://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaVnriHhPc] and [Instagram] If you want to follow future stuff @artBoffin or @artboffin on Twitter . It‚Äôs like Bob Ross petting a koalalizarat. It's like a perceptual DDOS attack.

## [PhD] I hate "my" "field" (machine learning)

In machine learning, everyone seems to be chasing the same ball‚Äîtrying to squeeze out slightly better performance . The field moves so fast that, within six months of graduating, someone will likely have beaten your high score. And if your work had nothing else to offer beyond that number, it‚Äôll be forgotten the moment someone posts a higher one. The field has its own issues, but there is also a lot of quality work being done. I switched to computational neuroscience after a few years in engineering. I hate "my" "field" (machine learning) But I'm not suggesting that people in other fields are remembered more, or that recognition is something easily attainable.
